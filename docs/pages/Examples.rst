========
Examples
========

You can find the described example QML files in the
`qml_ros2_plugin repo examples directory <https://github.com/StefanFabian/qml_ros2_plugin/tree/master/examples>`_.

Subscription
==========

The subscriber example demonstrates how to create a ``Subscription`` in QML
using the *QML ROS Plugin*.

You can run the example using the ``qmlscene`` executable:

.. code-block::

  qmlscene subscription.qml

Publisher
=========

The publisher example publishes an ``example_interfaces/msg/Int32`` message on the topic that
the subscriber example subscribes to.
Coincidentally, the two examples can very well be used together.

To run, run:

.. code-block::

  qmlscene publisher.qml

URDF Tutorial UI
================

This example combines several of the functionalities provided by this library
and presents a user interface for the ``urdf_sim_tutorial`` diff drive example.

First, launch the example:

.. code-block::

  roslaunch urdf_sim_tutorial 13-diffdrive.launch

Next, launch the example UI:

.. code-block::

  qmlscene urdf_tutorial_combined.qml

It provides a top down view on the position of the robot and sliders to control
the forward and angular movement.

Logging
=======

This example demonstrates the logging functionality detailed in :ref:`Logging`.
The "Output logging level" sets the minimum logging level that is printed whereas the
"Message logging level" sets the level of the message that is logged when you click
the `Log` button.

To run, run:

.. code-block::

  qmlscene logging.qml
